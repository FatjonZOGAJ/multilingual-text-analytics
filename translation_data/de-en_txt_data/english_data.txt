Aclasta is given as a 100 ml infusion, lasting at least 15 minutes.
This can be repeated once a year in patients being treated for osteoporosis.
For Paget’ s disease, only one infusion of Aclasta is given.
The effect of the infusion lasts for a year or more.
Aclasta is not recommended for use in patients who have severe problems with their kidneys.
In women, osteoporosis is more common after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
The active substance in Aclasta, zoledronic acid, is a bisphosphonate.
In Paget’ s disease, Aclasta was more effective than risedronate.
2/ 3 The full EPAR for Aclasta is available here.
This summary was last updated in 09-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Retreatment of Paget’ s disease: specific retreatment data are not available.
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes.
For information on the infusion of Aclasta, see section 6.6.
Aclasta is contraindicated for patients with hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4).
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta.
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated (e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium malabsorption).
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
Specific drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with zoledronic acid.
Zoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion.
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human breast milk.
The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Uncommon: dysgeusia, oesophagitis, toothache. † Common in Paget’ s disease only.
Renal dysfunction has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or additional risk factors (e. g oncology patients with chemotherapy, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, severe dehydration), the majority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3– 4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after a single administration.
No symptomatic cases of hypocalcaemia were observed.
There is no experience of acute intoxication with Aclasta.
It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
Thereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range.
Concomitant osteoporosis therapy included: calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, tibolone; but excluded other bisphosphonates.

Approximately 42% of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45% of the patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5.
Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip fracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture repair.
The study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture, but a trend was seen towards reduction in new hip fractures.
This corresponds to a 28% reduction in the risk of all cause mortality (p=0.01).
After 6 months, Aclasta showed 96% (169/ 176) and 89% (156/ 176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) normalisation rates compared to 74% (127/ 171) and 58% (99/ 171) for risedronate (all p < 0.001).
No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with zoledronic acid.
Therefore, interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.
Aclasta must not be allowed to come into contact with any calcium-containing solutions.

The active substance in Agenerase, amprenavir, is a protease inhibitor.
Ritonavir is another protease inhibitor that is used as a ‘ booster’.
See the Package Leaflet for the full list of these medicines.
Agenerase boosted with ritonavir must not be taken by patients who have severe problems with their liver, or by patients taking rifampicin (used to treat tuberculosis) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as ritonavir, such as flecainide and propafenone (used to correct irregular heartbeat).
See the Package Leaflet for full details.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 20 October 2005.

Should an intolerable skin reaction occur, the cream should be removed by washing the area with mild soap and water.
Alternative forms of contraception should be considered.
In immunocompromised patients, repeat treatment with imiquimod cream is not recommended.
There is an association between the complete clearance rate and the intensity of local skin reactions (e.g. erythema).
The skin surface area treated should be protected from solar exposure.
The clinical outcome of therapy can be determined after regeneration of the treated skin, approximately 4-8 weeks after the end of treatment.
No data are available on re-treating actinic keratoses that have cleared after one or two courses of treatment and subsequently recur, and any such use is therefore not recommended.
The skin surface area treated should be protected from solar exposure.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
Lower frequencies from clinical trials are not reported here.
Skin infections during treatment with imiquimod have been observed.

Aprovel is a medicine that contains the active substance irbesartan.
Aprovel is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Aprovel is taken by mouth, with or without food.
The usual recommended dose is 150 mg once a day.
Aprovel was originally studied in 11 trials for its effects on blood pressure.
Aprovel was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in 712 patients, and compared with other medicines for 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
Aprovel was used for two years or more.
The second study looked at whether Aprovel increased the time taken until the patients ’ blood creatinine levels had doubled (a marker of kidney disease), until they needed a kidney transplant or dialysis, or until they died.
In this study, Aprovel was compared with placebo and with amlodipine.
There was a 23% relative risk reduction compared with amlodipine.
The main benefit was on the effect on blood creatinine levels.
Its use during the first three months of pregnancy is not recommended.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aprovel to Sanofi Pharma Bristol-Myers Squibb SNC on 27 August 1997.
The full EPAR for Aprovel is available here.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function.
Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Aprovel.
Therefore, the use of Aprovel is not recommended.
Similar effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far.
Therefore, this combination is not recommended (see section 4.4).
The combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Aprovel is contraindicated (see section 4.3) during breast-feeding.
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/ or gastric lavage.
Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity.
Peak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood pressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.
The antihypertensive effects are maintained during long term therapy.
7 The blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive.
When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e. g.
No significant difference was apparent between these doses.
Adjusted mean change of trough seated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows:
The predefined blood pressure goal was ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg.
While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients.
However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.
Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit.

While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients.
However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.
Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit.

APTIVUS is a medicine containing the active substance tipranavir.
It is available as pink capsules (250 mg).
APTIVUS is an antiviral medicine.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The recommended dose of APTIVUS is 500 mg twice a day.
The active substance in APTIVUS, tipranavir, is a protease inhibitor.
It slows down the rate at which tipranavir is broken down, increasing the levels of tipranavir in the blood.
See the Package Leaflet for the full list of these medicines.
See the Package Leaflet for full details.
APTIVUS has been authorised under “ Exceptional Circumstances”.
The full EPAR for APTIVUS can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 02-2007.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Each capsule is pink and is imprinted with “ TPV 250”.
APTIVUS/ ritonavir should not be used in treatment-naïve patients.
Patients with moderate or severe (Child-Pugh B or C) hepatic impairment.
3 APTIVUS is not a cure for HIV-1 infection or AIDS.
Appropriate precautions should continue to be employed.
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) should be closely monitored.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
Increased ALAT/ ASAT monitoring should be considered in these patients.
Therefore, this study was prematurely stopped after 60 weeks.
A causal relationship has been evoked, although the mechanism of action had not been elucidated.
The significance of this finding is being further studied.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate (see section 4.8).
APTIVUS contains macrogolglycerol ricinoleate which may cause stomach upset and diarrhoea.
Caution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.
If unavoidable, upward dose adjustments for either omeprazole or esomeprazole may be considered based on clinical response to therapy.
Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4 activities were observed.
Practical recommendations deriving from this study are displayed below.
There is no impact on glucuronidated-ZDV levels.
The clinical relevance of the reduction in didanosine levels has not been established.
No dosage adjustment of lamivudine or stavudine is recommended.
Consequently, this co-administration is not recommended.
No information is available for the parameters AUC and Cmax.
Higher doses of carbamazepine may result in even larger decreases in tipranavir plasma concentrations.
Fluconazole doses > 200 mg/ day are not recommended.
Other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be considered such as pravastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin.
Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause profound decreases in concentrations of other protease inhibitors which can result in virological failure and resistance development.
Rifabutin increases the Cmin of tipranavir by 16%.
Whilst the changes in clarithromycin parameters are not considered clinically relevant, the reduction in the 14-OH metabolite AUC should be considered for the treatment of infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae in which the 14-OH metabolite is most active.
Clarithromycin increases the Cmin of tipranavir by more than 100%.
This large increase in Cmin may be clinically relevant.
No dosage adjustments for patients with normal renal function are necessary.
Dosage of methadone may need to be increased.
In clinical pharmacokinetic studies of tipranavir/ ritonavir in combination with omeprazole (40 mg qd), no clinically important changes in tipranavir/ ritonavir plasma concentrations were observed and thus no tipranavir/ ritonavir dose adjustment is required.
Similar effects were observed for the S-enantiomer, esomeprazole.
APTIVUS co-administered with low-dose ritonavir at steady-state resulted in approximately a 50% decrease in bupropion Cmax and AUC0-12h.
This effect may be due to induction of bupropion metabolism.
There was no relevant change in TPV Cmin.
13 analysis showed that the AUC and Cmax of loperamide are reduced by 51% and 61%, respectively, and the Cmin of tipranavir by 26%.
The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown.
Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
APTIVUS adversely interacts with oral contraceptives.
Patients should be informed that APTIVUS soft capsules contain small amounts of alcohol (7% ethanol, ie 100 mg per capsule or 200 mg per dose).
Most patients were able to continue treatment with APTIVUS/ ritonavir.
The significance of this finding is being further studied.
Very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10)
The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).
There is no known antidote for APTIVUS overdose.
Tipranavir inhibits the replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1 and clinical isolates in acute models of T-cell infection, with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50 and EC90) ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 µM (18-42 ng/ ml) and 0.07 to 0.18 µM (42-108 ng/ ml), respectively.
The development of resistance to tipranavir in vitro is slow and complex.
Tipranavir maintains significant antiviral activity (< 4-fold resistance) against the majority of HIV-1 clinical isolates showing post-treatment decreased susceptibility to the currently approved protease inhibitors: amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir.
The 1483 patients included in the primary analysis had a median age of 43 years (range 17-80), were 86% male, 75% white, 13% black and 1% Asian.
A total of 10% of patients had previously used enfuvirtide.
One patient in the APTIVUS arm had four mutations.
Baseline phenotypic susceptibility was evaluated in 454 baseline patient samples.
* Composite endpoint defined as patients with a confirmed 1 log RNA drop from baseline and without evidence of treatment failure ** Comparator PI/ RTV:
This score has been determined from the selected RESIST patient population having specific mutation inclusion criteria and therefore extrapolation to a wider population mandates caution.
Dosing with APTIVUS 500 mg concomitant with 200 mg ritonavir twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks and without meal restriction produced a mean tipranavir peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 94.8 ± 22.8 µM for female patients (n=14) and 77.6 ± 16.6 µM for male patients (n=106), occurring approximately 3 hours after administration.
Tipranavir is extensively bound to plasma proteins (> 99.9%).
By contrast, evaluation of the steady-state plasma tipranavir trough concentrations at 10-14 h after dosing from the RESIST-1 and RESIST-2 studies demonstrate that females generally had higher tipranavir concentrations than males.
This difference in concentrations does not warrant a dose adjustment.
The clinical implications of these findings are not known.
Store in a refrigerator (2 - 8°C).

Arixtra is a solution for injection in a prefilled syringe.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
In the prevention studies, Arixtra was compared with other anticoagulants: enoxaparin (in hip or knee surgery; over 8,000 patients) or dalteparin (in abdominal surgery; 2,927 patients).
In the study of myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation, Arixtra reduced the risk of death or another heart attack by 14% after 30 days, compared to standard care.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
This summary was last updated in 09-2007.
Each pre-filled syringe (0.3 ml) contains 1.5 mg of fondaparinux sodium.

The solution is a clear and colourless liquid.
- severe renal impairment defined by creatinine clearance < 20 ml/ min.
Fondaparinux is intended for subcutaneous use only.
Elderly patients The elderly population is at increased risk of bleeding.
Elimination of fondaparinux decreases with weight.
Renal impairment Fondaparinux is known to be mainly excreted by the kidney.

Fondaparinux is excreted in rat milk but it is not known whether fondaparinux is excreted in human milk.
Oral absorption by the child is however unlikely.
There is no known antidote to fondaparinux.
By binding selectively to ATIII, fondaparinux potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII.
However, rare spontaneous reports of aPTT prolongation have been received.
In a pooled analysis of these studies, the recommended dose regimen of fondaparinux versus enoxaparin was associated with a significant decrease (54% [95% CI, 44%; 63%]) in the rate of VTE evaluated up to day 11 after surgery, irrespective of the type of surgery performed.
The majority of endpoint events were diagnosed by a prescheduled venography and consisted mainly of distal DVT, but the incidence of proximal DVT was also significantly reduced.
Sixty-nine percent of the patients underwent surgery for cancer.
The majority of events were asymptomatic distal DVT.
Plasma concentrations of half the mean Cmax values are reached 25 minutes post-dosing.
Distribution The distribution volume of fondaparinux is limited (7-11 litres).
Fondaparinux is excreted to 64 – 77% by the kidney as unchanged compound.
Consequently, unbound concentrations of fondaparinux are expected to be unchanged in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary based on pharmacokinetics.
Instruction for self-administration is mentioned in the Package Leaflet.
Each pre-filled syringe (0.5 ml) contains 2.5 mg of fondaparinux sodium.

At Day 9 the incidence of major bleeding on fondaparinux and enoxaparin was 2.1% and 4.1%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI, 0.44; 0.61, p < 0.001).
The mean treatment duration was 6.2 days on fondaparinux.
In the predefined stratum comparing fondaparinux to UFH (patients treated with primary PCI (58.5%), fibrin-specific lytics (13%), non-fibrin-specific lytics (2.6%) and no reperfusion (25.9%), the effects of fondaparinux and UFH on the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 were not statistically different: respectively, 8.3% vs 8.7% (hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI, 0.79, 1.11 p = 0.460).
In patients treated with primary PCI, the incidence of death/ re-MI at Day 30 was not statistically different between the two groups [6.0% in fondaparinux group vs 4.8% in the control group; hazard ratio 1.26, 95% CI, 0.96, 1.66].

The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The suspension needs to be shaken before use.
Azopt should not be used in patients with severe kidney disease.
The active substance in Azopt, brinzolamide, is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.
In three studies, Azopt, given on its own twice or three times a day, was compared with dorzolamide (another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) and with 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
Two studies compared the effects of adding Azopt, dorzolamide or placebo (a dummy treatment) to timolol over three months.
When used alone, Azopt was less effective than timolol.
In a patient with glaucoma, the eye pressure is generally higher than 21 mmHg.
Dorzolamide led to decreases of between 4.3 and 4.9 mmHg.
Azopt was also more effective than placebo when used as an add-on to timolol.
Azopt contains benzalkonium chloride, which is known to discolour soft contact lenses.
Therefore, care should be taken by people who wear soft contact lenses.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.

The specific activity of BeneFIX is not less than 200 IU/ mg protein.
BeneFIX contains recombinant coagulation factor IX, (INN = nonacog alfa).
Nonacog alfa is a purified protein that has 415 amino acids in a single chain.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Factor IX products rarely require to be administered more than once daily.
Estimation of the required dose of BeneFIX can be based on the finding that one unit of factor IX activity per kg body weight is expected to increase the circulating level of factor IX, an average of 0.8 IU/ dl (range from 0.4 to 1.4 IU/ dl) in adult patients (≥ 15 years).
In a clinical study for routine secondary prophylaxis the average dose for previously treated patients (PTP) was 40 IU/ kg (range 13 to 78 IU/ kg) at intervals of 3 to 4 days.
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors.

Betaferon is a powder and solvent, which is made into a solution for injection.
It contains 250 micrograms (8 million international units - MIU) per ml of the active substance interferon beta-1b.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Betaferon is given by a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.
The main measure of effectiveness was the reduction in the number of relapses.
As the company had supplied the additional information requested, the "Exceptional Circumstances" ended on 3 April 2001.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Betaferon to Schering Aktiengesellschaft on 30 November 1995.
The full EPAR for Betaferon is available here.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
The titration period may be adjusted, if any significant adverse reaction occurs.
The optimal dose has not been fully clarified.
There have been reports of thrombocytopenia, with profound decreases in platelet count.
The most serious events often occurred in patients exposed to other drugs or substances known to be associated with hepatotoxicity or in the presence of comorbid medical conditions (e. g. metastasising malignant disease, severe infection and sepsis, alcohol abuse).
Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury.
In the absence of clinical evidence for liver damage and after normalisation of liver enzymes a reintroduction of therapy could be considered with appropriate follow-up of hepatic functions.
It can be extensive and may involve muscle fascia as well as fat and therefore can result in scar formation.
Occasionally debridement and, less often, skin grafting are required and healing may take up to 6 months.
It has been demonstrated in vitro that Betaferon cross reacts with natural interferon beta.
Caution should be exercised when Betaferon is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e. g. anti-epileptics.
Interferons belong to the family of cytokines, which are naturally occurring proteins.
Interferon beta-1b also enhances the suppressor activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Furthermore, there was a prolongation of the relapse-free interval.
Patients with mild disease and those unable to walk were not studied.
Moreover, an autoinjector was used by the majority of patients throughout the study.
No acute toxicity studies have been carried out.
No malformations have been observed in the surviving animals.
No influence on the monkey oestrous cycle has been observed.

This summary was last updated in 09-2008.
Each pre-filled syringe contains 30 MIU (300 µg) of filgrastim in 0.5 ml solution for injection or infusion.
Each ml of solution contains 50 mg of sorbitol.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Biograstim is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC).
The subcutaneous route is preferred in most cases.
The choice of route should depend on the individual clinical circumstance.
In randomised clinical trials, a subcutaneous dose of 23 MIU (230 μ g)/ m2/ day (4.0 to 8.4 μ g/ kg/ day) was used.
The recommended starting dose of filgrastim is 1.0 MIU (10 μ g)/ kg/ day given as a 30 minute or 24 hour intravenous infusion or 1.0 MIU (10 μ g)/ kg/ day given by continuous 24 hour subcutaneous infusion.
In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses may be necessary.
In other circumstances, additional leukaphereses are recommended.
Congenital neutropenia The recommended starting dose is 1.2 MIU (12 μ g)/ kg/ day subcutaneously as a single dose or in divided doses.
Idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia The recommended starting dose is 0.5 MIU (5 μ g)/ kg/ day subcutaneously as a single dose or in divided doses.
In a small number of patients (< 10%), doses up to 1.0 MIU (10 μ g)/ kg/ day were required to achieve reversal of neutropenia.
In clinical studies, dosing with 30 MIU (300 μ g)/ day on 1 to 7 days per week was required to maintain the ANC
Elderly patients Clinical trials with filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies have not been performed in this group and therefore specific dosage recommendations cannot be made.
Dose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Therefore, filgrastim is not indicated for use in these conditions.
Long-term safety follow-up of donors is ongoing.
This observation has only been made in patients with congenital neutropenia.
MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease and are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy.
Splenic enlargement is a direct effect of treatment with filgrastim.
Dose reductions were noted to slow or stop the progression of splenic enlargement and in 3% of patients a splenectomy was required.
Regular urinanalysis should be performed to monitor this event.
During intermittent dosing with 30 MIU (300 μ g)/ day of filgrastim, there can be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
In cancer patients
Transient decreases in blood pressure, not requiring clinical treatment, have been reported occasionally.
The causal association with filgrastim has not been established.
Exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis has been observed in individual cases.
Exacerbation of arthritic symptoms has been observed very rarely.
Transient, moderate decreases in non-fasting blood glucose have also been seen.

Reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium.
The same dose recommendations as for adults should be followed.
For mild to moderate hepatic impairment: as sugammadex is mainly excreted renally no dose adjustments are required.
There is only limited experience with the use of sugammadex in infants (30 days to 2 years), and term newborn infants (less than 30 days) have not been studied.
Sugammadex should be administered intravenously as a single bolus injection.
Sugammadex has only been administered as a single bolus injection in clinical trials.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
As a result re-occurrence of blockade might be observed.
In this situation the patient must be ventilated.
Sugammadex is not metabolised nor excreted by the liver; therefore dedicated studies in patients with hepatic impairment have not been conducted.
Each ml solution contains 9.7 mg sodium.
The routine precautions for treating arrhythmia should be taken into consideration.
For re-administration of sugammadex see section 4.2.
The interaction between 4 mg/ kg sugammadex and a progestogen was predicted to lead to a decrease in progestogen exposure (34% of AUC) similar to the decrease seen when a missed daily dose of an oral contraceptive is taken 12 hours too late, which might lead to a reduction in effectiveness.
For estrogens, the effect is expected to be lower.
For sugammadex no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
Caution should be exercised when administering sugammadex to pregnant women.
Animal studies have shown excretion of sugammadex in breast milk.
Sugammadex can be used during breast-feeding.
In one clinical trial in patients with a history of pulmonary complications bronchospasm was reported as a possibly related adverse event in two patients and a causal relationship could not be fully excluded.

Busilvex is administered prior the conventional haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT).
Administration Busilvex must be diluted prior to administration (see section 6.6).
Busilvex should be administered by intravenous infusion via central venous catheter.
In adults all studied patients received phenytoin.
In paediatric patients, absolute neutrophil counts < 0.5x109/ l at a median of 3 days post transplant occurred in 100% of patients and lasted 5 and 18.5 days in autologous and allogeneic transplant respectively.
Therefore Busilvex should be used with caution in this type of patients.
Busilvex as well as busulfan has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.
Seizures have been reported with high dose busulfan treatment.
Patients should receive adequate anti-convulsant prophylaxis.
The solvent dimethylacetamide (DMA) may also impair fertility.
Therefore special care is recommended when combining these two compounds.
A few cases of congenital abnormalities have been reported with low-dose oral busulfan, not necessarily attributable to the active substance, and third trimester exposure may be associated with impaired intrauterine growth.
Myelo-suppression and immuno-suppression were the desired therapeutic effects of the conditioning regimen.
Therefore all patients experienced profound cytopenia: leukopenia 96%, thrombocytopenia 94%, and anemia 88%.
A total of 11 patients (18%) experienced a-GVHD.
Acute GVHD was rated as serious in 3 patients.
Chronic GVHD (c-GVHD) was reported if serious or the cause of death, and was reported as the cause of death in 3 patients.
Other infections were considered severe in 3% of patients.
15% of SAEs involved liver toxicity.
Elevated bilirubine (n=3) and elevated AST (n=1) were also observed.
A total of 14 patients (50%) experienced a-GVHD.
Chronic GVHD was reported only if it is the cause of death: one patient died 13 months post-transplant.
Mild/ moderate fever was reported in 76% of patients.
Grade 3 elevated transaminases were reported in 24% of patients.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse events are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
There have been two reports that busulfan is dialyzable, thus dialysis should be considered in the case of an overdose.
CNS changes precede any of the more severe side effects.
No specific antidote for DMA overdose is known.
In case of overdose, management would include general supportive care.
All patients experienced a profound myelosuppression.
All children engrafted.
There is no primary or secondary graft rejection.
93% of allogeneic patients showed complete chimerism.

Carbaglu is a medicine that contains the active substance carglumic acid.
This enzyme normally helps to break down ammonia.
Because the number of patients with NAGS deficiency is low, it is considered ‘ rare’ and Carbaglu was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 18 October 2000.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Treatment may be started as early as the first day of life.
When this happens, ammonia builds up in the blood.

CELSENTRI should be taken as part of an antiretroviral combination regimen.
Other phenotypic and genotypic assays are currently being evaluated.
CCR5 antagonists could potentially impair the immune response to certain infections.
This should be taken into consideration when treating infections such as active tuberculosis and invasive fungal infections.
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, can have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.
Discontinuation of CELSENTRI should be considered in any patient with signs or symptoms of acute hepatitis, in particular if drug-related hypersensitivity is suspected or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms of potential hypersensitivity (e. g. pruritic rash, eosinophila or elevated IgE).

Cholestagel is a medicine that contains the active substance colesevelam.
It is available as white tablets (625 mg).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The active substance in Cholestagel, colesevelam, is not absorbed by the body, but stays in the gut, where it attaches to substances called bile acids and carries them out of the body in the faeces.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 10 March 2009.
The full EPAR for Cholestagel is available here.
This summary was last updated in 03-2009.
Each tablet contains 625 mg colesevelam (as hydrochloride).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Off-white, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets imprinted with “ Cholestagel” on one side.
The maximum recommended dose is 7 tablets per day.
Cholestagel reduces the bioavailability of ciclosporin (see also section 4.5).
Cholestagel can induce or worsen present constipation.
In general Cholestagel may affect the bioavailability of other medicinal products.
4 Co-administration of Cholestagel and repaglinide had no effect on the AUC and caused a 19% reduction in the Cmax of repaglinide, the clinical significance of which is unknown.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
Caution should be exercised when prescribing to breast-feeding women.
Adverse reactions were generally mild or moderate in intensity.
Cholesterol is the sole precursor of bile acids.
During normal digestion, bile acids are secreted into the intestine.
A concomitant increase in very low density lipoprotein synthesis can occur.
Reductions were also seen for non-HDL-C, Total-C and Apo B.
A small 5%, non-significant increase in triglycerides was noted.
Cholestagel is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

CIALIS is not indicated for use by women.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
- patients with a stroke within the last 6 months.
Agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, including CIALIS, should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia).
It is not known if CIALIS is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve- sparing prostatectomy.
The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not recommended.
Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known.
Therefore this combination is not recommended (see section 4.4).
The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg).
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic agents were not conducted.
CIALIS is not indicated for use by women.
For tadalafil no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache and dyspepsia.
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.
Tadalafil has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/ 0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/ 4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no significant change in heart rate.
In the study in patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46% on CIALIS 5mg and 2.5mg, respectively, as compared to 28% with placebo.
At therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins.
Protein binding is not affected by impaired renal function.
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.
This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats.

For further information please refer to section 5.1.
The optimal duration of treatment has not been formally established.
Antacids did not modify the extent of clopidogrel absorption.
As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should not be continued during treatment with Clopidogrel BMS.
Within each system organ class, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Overdose following clopidogrel administration may lead to prolonged bleeding time and subsequent bleeding complications.
No antidote to the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel has been found.
Biotransformation of clopidogrel is necessary to produce inhibition of platelet aggregation.
Clopidogrel acts by irreversibly modifying the platelet ADP receptor.
Consequently, platelets exposed to clopidogrel are affected for the remainder of their lifespan and recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with platelet turnover.
Patients were treated for up to one year.
The patients were followed for 30 days.
31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, 54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins.
Clopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver and the main metabolite, which is inactive, is the carboxylic acid derivative, which represents about 85% of the circulating compound in plasma.
This metabolite has not been detected in plasma.
The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration range.
In addition, clinical tolerance was good in all patients.
There was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to mice and 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/ kg per day (representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/ day).

Overdose following clopidogrel administration may lead to prolonged bleeding time and subsequent bleeding complications.
No antidote to the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel has been found.
Biotransformation of clopidogrel is necessary to produce inhibition of platelet aggregation.
Repeated doses of 75 mg per day produced substantial inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation from the first day; this increased progressively and reached steady state between Day 3 and Day 7.
Patients were treated for up to one year.
The patients were followed for 30 days.
31.1%), 89.5% heparin, 78.7% beta blockers, 54.7% ACE inhibitors and 63% statins.
Clopidogrel is extensively metabolised by the liver and the main metabolite, which is inactive, is the carboxylic acid derivative, which represents about 85% of the circulating compound in plasma.
This metabolite has not been detected in plasma.
The binding is non-saturable in vitro over a wide concentration range.
In addition, clinical tolerance was good in all patients.
There was no evidence of carcinogenic effect when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to mice and 104 weeks to rats when given at doses up to 77 mg/kg per day (representing at least 25 times the exposure seen in humans receiving the clinical dose of 75 mg/day).

In patients with early HIV disease haematological adverse reactions are infrequent.
Depending on the overall condition of the patient, blood tests may be performed less often, for example every one to three months.
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
Zidovudine is primarily eliminated by hepatic conjugation to an inactive glucuronidated metabolite.
The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently with Combivir should be considered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion, especially via the cationic transport system e. g. trimethoprim.
Given the limited data available the clinical significance of this is unknown.
Exacerbation of anaemia due to ribavirin has been reported when zidovudine is part of the regimen used to treat HIV although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.
Clarithromycin tablets reduce the absorption of zidovudine.
However, no such data are available for lamivudine.

Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain.
However, the incidence of oedema, weight gain and heart failure were increased.
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed.
Metformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.
Metformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4).
This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term clinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels.
Steady state is achieved after 4– 7 days of dosing.
Absorption is not influenced by food intake.
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/ kg.
Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged.
After oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.
It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.
The clinical relevance of this decrease is unknown.
The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution.
The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l.
Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 h.
In addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed.
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone.
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
Two studies (involving 1,891 patients) compared the effects of the combination in patients whose hypertension was not adequately controlled with either 10 mg amlodipine or 160 mg valsartan.
The blood pressure was measured in ‘ millimetres of mercury’ (mmHg).
The full EPAR for Copalia can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
The recommended dose of Copalia is one tablet per day.
Copalia can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Copalia with some water.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Copalia has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Copalia.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).

Cystadane is used to treat homocystinuria.
Because the number of patients with homocystinuria is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Cystadane was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 9 July 2001.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
This is usually achieved within a month.
It should be dissolved fully in water, juice, milk, formula or food immediately before being taken.

The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Dafiro contains two active substances, amlodipine and valsartan.
7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
Two studies (involving 1,891 patients) compared the effects of the combination in patients whose hypertension was not adequately controlled with either 10 mg amlodipine or 160 mg valsartan.
The blood pressure was measured in ‘ millimetres of mercury’ (mmHg).
The full EPAR for Dafiro can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
The recommended dose of Dafiro is one tablet per day.
Dafiro can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Dafiro with some water.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Particular caution should be exercised when administering Dafiro to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders.
Dafiro has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Dafiro.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).

Effentora is a medicine containing the active substance fentanyl.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Effentora is taken at the start of a breakthrough pain episode.
The usual starting dose is one 100 microgram tablet, but this can be increased until the appropriate maintenance dose is found.
It is a well-known substance, which has been used to control pain for many years.
Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
Effentora, fentanyl is given as a buccal tablet, so that the fentanyl is absorbed through the lining of the mouth.
The first study included 72 patients and the second included 78.
Each patient ranked their pain intensity on an 11-point scale.
The most common side effects with Effentora (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are dizziness, nausea (feeling sick) and reactions at the site of application including pain, ulcers, irritation, unusual sensations, numbness, redness, swelling and spots.
Patients should be closely monitored for these side effects.
The full EPAR for Effentora can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 04-2008.
Each buccal tablet contains 100 micrograms fentanyl (as citrate).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Physicians should keep in mind the potential of abuse of fentanyl.
Doses above 800 micrograms were not evaluated in clinical studies.
Effentora should be placed and retained within the buccal cavity for a period sufficient to allow disintegration of the tablet which usually takes approximately 14-25 minutes.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Opioids may obscure the clinical course of a patient with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted.
Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia.
Careful consideration should be given to patients with hypovolaemia and hypotension.
This medicinal product contains 8 mg sodium per tablet.
Coadministration with agents that induce 3A4 activity may reduce the efficacy of Effentora.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Following long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant.
However, the most serious adverse reactions are respiratory depression (potentially leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension and shock and all patients should be closely monitored for these.
Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic, interacting predominantly with the opioid µ-receptor.
Its primary therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation.
The analgesic effects of fentanyl are related to its plasma level.
The rate of development of tolerance varies widely among individuals.
All opioid µ-receptor agonists, including fentanyl, produce dose dependent respiratory depression.
Patients assessed pain intensity on a 11-point scale.
The main pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in the following table.

The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The maximum dose of sitagliptin is 100 mg a day.
It works by blocking the breakdown of 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
By increasing the levels of incretin hormones in the blood, sitagliptin stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin when blood glucose levels are high.
Sitagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low.
Sitagliptin taken in combination with metformin was more effective than metformin alone.

Therefore, a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea may be necessary.
Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations.
Efficib should not be used during pregnancy.
Metformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts.
Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell (WBC) count (approximately 200 cells/ microl difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6,600 cells/ microl) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils.
This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.
Table 2 presents adverse reactions by system organ class and by frequency category.
No data are available with regard to overdose of Efficib.
In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session.
The DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of agents that act as incretin enhancers.
By inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, sitagliptin increases the levels of two known active incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner.
The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).
Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin.
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.
Elderly No dose adjustment is required based on age.
The clinical relevance of this decrease is unknown.
Distribution Plasma protein binding is negligible.
The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution.
The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l.
Metabolism Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
No metabolites have been identified in humans.
The relevance of these findings for humans is unknown.
In addition, very slight to slight skeletal muscle degeneration was also observed histologically at doses resulting in systemic exposure levels of approximately 23 times

The effects of Efient were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans.
The patients were followed up for an average of 14.5 months.
The full EPAR for Efient can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 01-2009.
Each tablet contains 5 mg prasugrel (as hydrochloride).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
2 The 10 mg maintenance dose is not recommended.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
History of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
In these patients the 10 mg maintenance dose is not recommended.
These patients may have an increased bleeding risk.
Therapeutic experience with prasugrel is limited in Asian patients.
TTP is a serious condition and requires prompt treatment.
Concomitant administration with chronic NSAIDs has not been studied.
Efient is to be administered concomitantly with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
Therefore, both medicinal products can be administered concomitantly.
Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, did not affect prasugrel-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation or the prasugrel active metabolite’ s AUC and Tmax, but decreased the Cmax by 34% to 46%.
The use of prasugrel during breastfeeding is not recommended.
No significant difference was seen in the STEMI population.
Since platelets participate in the initiation and/ or evolution of thrombotic complications of atherosclerotic disease, inhibition of platelet function can result in the reduction of the rate of cardiovascular events such as death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.
Mean steady-state inhibition of platelet aggregation was 74% and 69% respectively for 5 µM ADP and 20 µM ADP, and was achieved following 3 to 5 days of administration of the 10 mg prasugrel maintenance dose preceded by a 60 mg loading dose.
Similar or higher inhibition of platelet aggregation was observed with prasugrel.
Efient was administered without regard to food in TRITON.
Metabolism Prasugrel is not detected in plasma following oral administration.
There is no difference in exposure among Chinese, Japanese, and Korean subjects.
No dose adjustment is recommended based on ethnicity alone.
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.

Elaprase is used to treat patients with Hunter syndrome.
Patients with Hunter syndrome do not produce an enzyme called iduronate-2-sulfatase.
Without treatment, these symptoms become more severe over time.
Because the number of patients with Hunter syndrome is low, the disease is rare, and Elaprase was designated an ‘ orphan medicine’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 11 December 2001.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Elaprase is given every week, as an infusion (drip into a vein).
Other very common side effects were dyspepsia (heartburn) and chest pain.
Elaprase has been authorised under ‘ exceptional circumstances’.

- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
- Concomitant treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.5).
Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes may increase darifenacin exposure.
CYP3A4 inhibitors Darifenacin should not be used together with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see section 4.3) such as protease inhibitors (e. g. ritonavir), ketoconazole and itraconazole.
Other transporter-related interactions cannot be excluded.
Emselex is not recommended during pregnancy.
Lactation Darifenacin is excreted into the milk of rats.
For Emselex, these side effects have been reported to be uncommon.
A similar trend is also seen for the discontinuation rates.
6 Darifenacin is a selective muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist (M3 SRA) in vitro.
Darifenacin is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.
The information below
Absorption Due to extensive first-pass metabolism darifenacin has a bioavailability of approximately 15% and 19% after 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily doses at steady state.
The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) is estimated to be 163 litres.
The three main metabolic routes are as follows: monohydroxylation in the dihydrobenzofuran ring; dihydrobenzofuran ring opening and N-dealkylation of the pyrrolidine nitrogen.
Only a small percentage of the excreted dose was unchanged darifenacin (3%).
Estimated darifenacin clearance is 40 litres/ hour.
The elimination half-life of darifenacin following chronic dosing is approximately 13-19 hours.
In one pharmacokinetic study the steady-state exposure in poor metabolisers was 164% and 99% higher during treatment with 7.5 mg and 15 mg once daily, respectively.
However, protein binding of darifenacin was affected by moderate hepatic impairment.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
Two studies (involving 1,891 patients) compared the effects of the combination in patients whose hypertension was not adequately controlled with either 10 mg amlodipine or 160 mg valsartan.
The blood pressure was measured in ‘ millimetres of mercury’ (mmHg).
The full EPAR for Exforge can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
The recommended dose of Exforge is one tablet per day.
Exforge can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Exforge with some water.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Exforge has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Exforge.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).

Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Exforge has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk cannot be excluded.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.

Exjade is a medicine that contains the active substance deferasirox.
Because the number of patients with chronic iron overload is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and Exjade was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 13 March 2002.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
The company will also prepare a similar pack for patients.
The full EPAR for Exjade can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 08-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
The recommended initial daily dose of EXJADE is 20 mg/ kg body weight.
The dosing recommendations for elderly patients are the same as described above.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients with estimated creatinine clearance < 60 ml/ min.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
Tests for proteinuria should be performed monthly.
Multiple ulcers have been observed in some patients (see section 4.8).
Skin rashes may appear during EXJADE treatment.
The rashes resolve spontaneously in most cases.
However, a contributory or aggravating role cannot be excluded.
Cardiac dysfunction is a known complication of severe iron overload.
Deferasirox metabolism depends on UGT enzymes.
In the clinical setting, this effect may be more pronounced.
No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available for deferasirox.
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
No effect on the offspring was noted.
Breast- feeding while taking EXJADE is not recommended.
During clinical trials, increases in serum creatinine of > 33% on ≥ 2 consecutive occasions, sometimes above the upper limit of the normal range, occurred in about 36% of patients.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders
Deferasirox promotes excretion of iron, primarily in the faeces.
No inhibition of deferasirox metabolism by hydroxyurea was observed in vitro.
The mean elimination half-life (t 1/ 2)
The transporters MRP2 and MXR (BCRP) are involved in the biliary excretion of deferasirox.
The main findings were kidney toxicity and lens opacity (cataracts).
Similar findings were observed in neonatal and juvenile animals.
No such effects were observed in iron-preloaded rats.

There have been reports of thrombocytopenia, with profound decreases in platelet count.
The most serious events often occurred in patients exposed to other medicinal products or substances known to be associated with hepatotoxicity or in the presence of co-morbid medical conditions (e. g. metastasising malignant disease, severe infection and sepsis, alcohol abuse).
Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury.
In the absence of clinical evidence for liver damage, and after normalisation of liver enzymes, a reintroduction of therapy could be considered with appropriate follow-up of hepatic functions.
It can be extensive and may involve muscle fascia as well as fat and therefore can result in scar formation.

Fertavid is a solution for injection that contains the active substance follitropin beta.
Fertavid can only be obtained with a prescription.
The patient or their partner may carry out the injections.
For a full description of the doses, see the Package Leaflet.
The follitropin beta in Fertavid is produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce human FSH.
It must not be used in men with testicular failure.
For the full list of restrictions, see the Package Leaflet.
The full EPAR for Fertavid can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 01-2009.
This corresponds to a strength of 100 IU/ ml.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Fertavid is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations: • Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomifene citrate. • Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to induce the development of multiple follicles in medically assisted reproduction programs [e. g. in vitro fertilisation/ embryo transfer (IVF/ ET), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)].
In the male: • Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.
The dosage should, therefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response.
This requires ultrasonography and monitoring of oestradiol levels.
Oocyte retrieval is performed 34-35 hours later.
The patients should be advised of the potential risks of multiple births before starting treatment. • The first injection of Fertavid should be performed under direct medical supervision. • Since infertile women undergoing assisted reproduction, and particularly IVF, often have tubal abnormalities the incidence of ectopic pregnancies might be increased.
The diagnosis of ovarian hyperstimulation may be confirmed by ultrasound examination.
In rare cases severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurs, which may be life-threatening.
There is no indication for use of Fertavid during pregnancy.
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies.
Fertavid should not be used during breast-feeding.
The majority of these local reactions are mild and transient in nature.
They were all reported at an incidence of approximately 1% (pelvic pain and abdominal distension) or less.
In rare instances, thromboembolism has been associated with Fertavid/ hCG therapy as with other gonadotrophins.
In one subject an epididymal cyst was observed.
Both have an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%.
6 The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/ or hydrochloric acid.
Store in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C).
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.
Do not use if the solution contains particles or if the solution is not clear.
This corresponds to a strength of 150 IU/ ml.

GANFORT should not be used by breast-feeding women.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: systemic lupus erythematosus.
Timolol Symptoms of systemic timolol overdose are: bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, and cardiac arrest.
GANFORT consists of two active substances: bimatoprost and timolol maleate.
GANFORT has a rapid onset of action.
Bimatoprost is a potent ocular hypotensive agent.
The prostamide receptor, however, has not yet been structurally identified.
Timolol lowers IOP by reducing aqueous humour formation.
There are no studies with evening dosing of GANFORT.
However, if necessary for patient compliance, an evening dosing may be considered.
6 In two 12-month studies where systemic absorption was measured, no accumulation was observed with either of the individual components.
In human blood, bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma.
The ocular and systemic safety profile of the individual components is well established.

HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for approximately 90% of genital warts and 10% of low grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1).
The primary analyses of efficacy, with respect to vaccine HPV types (HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18), were conducted in the per-protocol efficacy (PPE) population (n= all 3 vaccinations within 1 year of enrolment, no major protocol deviations and naïve to the relevant HPV type(s) prior to dose 1 and through 1 month Postdose 3 (Month 7)).
Point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.
The results are summarised in Table 2.
Note: point estimates and confidence intervals are adjusted for person-time of follow-up.
No minimum antibody level associated with protection has been identified for HPV vaccines.

Risk related to metformin Animal studies have not revealed teratogenic effects.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone.
Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite.
No data are available with regard to overdose of Glubrava.
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain.
However, the incidence of oedema, weight gain and heart failure were increased.
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed.
10 Metformin stimulates intracellular glycogen synthesis by acting on glycogen synthase.
Metformin increases the transport capacity of specific types of membrane glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4).
This has been shown at therapeutic doses in controlled, medium-term or long-term clinical studies: metformin reduces total cholesterol, LDLc and triglyceride levels.
Steady state is achieved after 4– 7 days of dosing.
Absorption is not influenced by food intake.
Distribution The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/ kg.
Thus free (unbound) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged.
After oral administration, metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete.
It is assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin absorption is non-linear.
The clinical relevance of this decrease is unknown.
The red blood cells most likely represent a secondary compartment of distribution.
The mean Vd ranged between 63 – 276 l.
Metabolism Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following an oral dose, the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 h.
In addition, increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed.
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone.
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex.

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone.
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than with placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin.
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin.
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain.
In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides.
These effects were independent of pioglitazone’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide.
However, the incidence of oedema, weight gain and heart failure were increased.
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed.

Hepsera is a medicine containing the active substance adefovir dipivoxil.
It is available as white round tablets (10 mg).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
These should be monitored every six months.
Hepsera was more effective than placebo in slowing down the progression of liver disease.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 6 March 2008.
The full EPAR for Hepsera is available here.
This summary was last updated in 04-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Higher doses must not be administered.
The optimum duration of treatment is unknown.
• Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Adefovir dipivoxil should not be administered concurrently with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread).
These patients should be followed closely.
In case of emergence of resistance, treatment should be modified.
Patients should be advised that therapy with adefovir dipivoxil has not been proven to reduce the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus to others and therefore appropriate precautions should still be taken.
Mothers should be instructed not to breast-feed if they are taking adefovir dipivoxil tablets.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequency not known: myopathy, osteomalacia (both associated with proximal renal tubulopathy).
No clinically significant changes in renal function were observed.
The elimination of adefovir by peritoneal dialysis has not been studied.
Five patients achieved and maintained HBsAg seroconversion (HBsAg negative/ HBsAb positive).
No patients became HBsAg- or HBeAg-negative during the study.
No long-term safety data or long-term resistance data are available with adefovir dipivoxil in children.
In patients receiving adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy (HBeAg negative study) the cumulative probability of developing adefovir-associated resistance mutations was 0%, 3%, 11%, 18% and 29% at 48, 96, 144, 192 and 240 weeks respectively.
Adefovir dipivoxil is a dipivaloyloxymethyl ester prodrug of the active substance adefovir.
The tmax was delayed by two hours.
Following oral administration, adefovir dipivoxil is rapidly converted to adefovir.
Pharmacokinetic studies were principally conducted in Caucasian patients.
A four-hour period of haemodialysis removed approximately 35% of the adefovir dose.
Hepsera is supplied in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child-resistant closure.
Each bottle contains 30 tablets, silica gel desiccant and fibre packing material.
Not all pack sizes may be marketed.

Humira is a medicine containing the active substance adalimumab.
It is available as a solution for injection in a vial, pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen, all containing 40 mg adalimumab.
Patients who need a more rapid response for Crohn’ s disease may need to start with two higher doses 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
For more information, see the Package Leaflet.
The active substance in Humira, adalimumab, is a monoclonal antibody.
Humira was more effective than placebo in all diseases studied.
The full EPAR for Humira can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 09-2008.
Each 0.8 ml single dose vial contains 40 mg of adalimumab.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Humira has not been studied in these patient populations.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class III/ IV) (see section 4.4).
Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported.
There have been reports of tuberculosis in patients receiving Humira.
The needle cover of the syringe contains natural rubber (latex).
Some of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on concomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for Crohn’ s disease.
All patients had a history of heavy smoking.
Adverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopoenia (e. g. thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia) have been infrequently reported with Humira.
Treatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies.
Administration of adalimumab is not recommended during pregnancy.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
The reported rates for non-melanoma skin cancers and lymphomas are approximately 0.2 and 0.4 per 1,000 patient years, respectively (see section 4.4).
The patients improved following discontinuation of therapy.
No patients developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms.
No dose-limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials.
The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple intravenous doses of 10 mg/ kg, which is approximately 15 times the recommended dose.
A rapid decrease in CRP levels was also observed in patients with Crohn’ s disease.
15 have been intolerant to 10 mg of methotrexate every week.
In RA study V with early rheumatoid arthritis patients who were methotrexate naïve, combination therapy with Humira and methotrexate led to faster and significantly greater ACR responses than methotrexate monotherapy and Humira monotherapy at Week 52 and responses were sustained at Week 104 (see Table 4).
The response for the two monotherapy arms was similar (p = 0.447).
Radiographic changes were assessed in the psoriatic arthritis studies.
Corticosteroid taper was permitted after Week 8.
Therapy continued beyond 12 weeks did not result in significantly more responses (see section 4.2).

Of the patients who lost adequate response after re-randomization to placebo who then enrolled into the open- label extension trial, 38% (25/ 66) and 55% (36/ 66) regained PASI 75 response after 12 and 24 weeks of re-treatment, respectively.
After subcutaneous administration of a single 40 mg dose, absorption and distribution of adalimumab was slow, with peak serum concentrations being reached about 5 days after administration.
Following subcutaneous administration of 40 mg of Humira every other week in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients the mean steady-state trough concentrations were approximately 5 µg/ ml (without concomitant methotrexate) and 8 to 9 µg/ ml (with concomitant methotrexate), respectively.
Following the administration of 24 mg/ m2 (up to a maximum of 40 mg) subcutaneously every other week to patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) the mean trough steady-state (values measured from Week 20 to 48) serum adalimumab concentration was 5.6 ± 5.6 µg/ mL (102 %CV) Humira monotherapy and 10.9 ± 5.2 µg/ mL (47.7% CV) with concomitant methotrexate.

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged.
Two studies (involving 1,891 patients) compared the effects of the combination in patients whose hypertension was not adequately controlled with either 10 mg amlodipine or 160 mg valsartan.
The blood pressure was measured in ‘ millimetres of mercury’ (mmHg).
The full EPAR for Imprida can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
The recommended dose of Imprida is one tablet per day.
Imprida can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Imprida with some water.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Imprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Imprida.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.
Hepatic impairment Patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting increase of approximately 40– 60% in AUC.
Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see section 4.2).
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- (amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).

The recommended dose of Imprida is one tablet per day.
Imprida can be used with or without food.
It is recommended to take Imprida with some water.
Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) and patients undergoing dialysis.
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see section 4.4 and 4.6).
Treatment can be continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.
Imprida has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension.
Interactions linked to amlodipine Caution required with concomitant use CYP3A4 inhibitors A study in elderly patients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50% and the effect of amlodipine is increased).
Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, as well as adequate hydration of the patient.
Others In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide.
However, there may be a risk of prolonged delivery.
Valsartan was excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation) has also been reported.
Cholestatic jaundice, AST and ALT increase, purpura, rash and pruritus.
Exceptional cases of extrapyramidal syndrome have been reported.
Symptoms There is no experience of overdose with Imprida.
Valsartan Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist.
Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much (about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.
The antihypertensive effect persists over 24 hours after administration.
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure.
Linearity Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.
Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 80%.
Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.
Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration for 7– 8 days.
Mean absolute bioavailability is 23%.
This reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.
Valsartan is primarily eliminated in faeces (about 83% of dose) and urine (about 13% of dose), mainly as unchanged drug.
The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.

Insuman Rapid is a neutral insulin solution (regular insulin).
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Diabetes mellitus where treatment with insulin is required.
There are no fixed rules for insulin dosage.
The need to adjust (e. g. reduce) the dose may become evident immediately after transfer.
Alternatively, it may emerge gradually over a period of several weeks.
- previously required high insulin doses due to the presence of insulin antibodies.
Insulin absorption and hence the blood glucose lowering effect of a dose may vary from one injection area to another (e. g. the abdominal wall compared with the thigh).
Insuman Rapid may also be administered intravenously.
For further details on handling, see section 6.6.
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.

INTEGRILIN exists as a solution for infusion and a solution for injection.
INTEGRILIN contains the active substance eptifibatide.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The medicine should not be used in patients with severe kidney problems.
The main benefit was in the reduction in further heart attacks.
Other side effects are uncommon or rare.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 1 July 2004.
The full EPAR for INTEGRILIN can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 02-2007.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
INTEGRILIN is intended for use with acetylsalicylic acid and unfractionated heparin.
There is no experience with INTEGRILIN and low molecular weight heparins.
In patients with previous thrombocytopaenia from other parenteral GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors, there are no data with the use of INTEGRILIN, and thus these patients require close monitoring as noted above.
Monitoring of laboratory values Before infusion of INTEGRILIN, the following laboratory tests are recommended before treatment to identify pre-existing haemostatic abnormalities: prothrombin time (PT) and aPTT, serum creatinine, platelet count, haemoglobin and haematocrit levels.
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Interruption of breast-feeding during the treatment period is recommended.
*Causality has not been determined for all adverse events.
*Causality has not been determined for all adverse events.
Thus, changes in laboratory parameters associated with bleeding (e. g., bleeding time) are common and expected.
Specifically, no patients experienced an intracranial bleed.
The effect of eptifibatide is observed immediately after administration of a 180 microgram/ kg intravenous bolus.
The placebo arm was comparable (aspirin 99.7%, clopidogrel 95.9%, ticlopidin 2.6%).
The clinical relevance of such enzymatic MIs is still controversial.
In healthy subjects, renal excretion accounted for approximately 50% of total body clearance; approximately 50% of the amount cleared is excreted unchanged.
In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/ min), the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50% and steady-state plasma levels are approximately doubled.
No formal pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been conducted.
No genotoxic effects were observed with eptifibatide.

INVANZ contains the active substance ertapenem.
The use of INVANZ in the treatment of infections in adults was compared to that of other antibiotics: it was compared with ceftriaxone in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 866 patients) and urinary tract infections (592 patients), and with a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam in abdominal 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
INVANZ also has an effect on some blood tests.
The full EPAR for INVANZ can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 03-2006.
Each vial contains 1.0 g ertapenem equivalent to 1.046 g ertapenem sodium.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion.
INVANZ should be infused over a period of 30 minutes.
Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these patients.
Repeated evaluation of the patient's condition is essential.
No data are available in children under 3 months of age.
Of evaluable patients treated with ertapenem in a clinical study for the treatment of intra- abdominal infections, in adults, 30% had generalized peritonitis and 39% had infections involving sites other than the appendix including the stomach, duodenum, small bowel, colon, and gallbladder; there were limited numbers of evaluable patients who were enrolled with APACHE II scores ≥ 15 and efficacy in these patients has not been established.
Therefore, caution should be exercised in such unusual cases.
This medicinal product contains approximately 6.0 mEq (approximately 137 mg) of sodium per 1.0 g dose which should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.
Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in pregnant women.
Adverse reactions (i. e., considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported in approximately 20% of patients treated with ertapenem.
For patients who received only INVANZ, the most common adverse reactions reported during therapy plus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped were: diarrhoea (4.8%), infused vein complication (4.5%) and nausea (2.8%).
The overall safety profile is comparable to that in adult patients.
Adverse reactions (i. e., considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the medicinal product) were reported in approximately 20.8% of patients treated with ertapenem.
For patients who received only INVANZ, the most common adverse reactions reported during therapy plus follow-up for 14 days after treatment was stopped were: diarrhoea (5.2%) and infusion site pain (6.1%).

Distribution Ertapenem is highly bound to human plasma proteins.
The major metabolite of ertapenem is the ring-opened derivative formed by dehydropeptidase-I-mediated hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring.
12 Elderly Plasma concentrations following a 1 g and 2 g intravenous dose of ertapenem are slightly higher (approximately 39% and 22%, respectively) in healthy elderly adults (≥ 65 years) relative to young adults (< 65 years).
Therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.
AUCs of total ertapenem and of unbound ertapenem are increased in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (Clcr 31 to 59 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) approximately 1.5-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, compared with healthy subjects.
There are no data in paediatric patients with renal insufficiency.
Therefore, ertapenem should not be used in these patients.

Therefore, the use of Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is not recommended.
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium, which may result in hypomagnaesemia.
Similar effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far.
Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum potassium.
Increase in dosage of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary.
Thiazides may increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine.
Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e. g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.
Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood.
Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is contraindicated during breast-feeding.
Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide BMS is unlikely to affect this ability.

The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
The maximum dose of sitagliptin is 100 mg a day.
It works by blocking the breakdown of 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
By increasing the levels of incretin hormones in the blood, sitagliptin stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin when blood glucose levels are high.
Sitagliptin does not work when the blood glucose is low.
Sitagliptin taken in combination with metformin was more effective than metformin alone.

Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing alcohol should be avoided.
Sitagliptin had a small effect on plasma digoxin concentrations.
Janumet should not be used during pregnancy.
Metformin is excreted in human milk in small amounts.
Across clinical studies, a small increase in white blood cell (WBC) count (approximately 200 cells/ microl difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6,600 cells/ microl) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils.
This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant.
Table 2 presents adverse reactions by system organ class and by frequency category.
No data are available with regard to overdose of Janumet.
In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour haemodialysis session.
The DPP-4 inhibitors are a class of agents that act as incretin enhancers.
By inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, sitagliptin increases the levels of two known active incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar across treatment groups.
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner.
The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).
Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine.
Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin.
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.

Data in heavily pretreated protease inhibitor experienced patients are limited.
No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Renal impairment: no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment.
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
These medicinal products include astemizole, terfenadine, oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administered midazolam, see section 4.5), triazolam, cisapride, pimozide, amiodarone, ergot alkaloids (e. g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine and methylergonovine) and vardenafil.
In some patients additional factor VIII was given.
Marked triglyceride elevation is a risk factor for development of pancreatitis.
66 pancreatitis should occur.
The long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.
Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete.
Consideration should be given to measurement of fasting serum lipids and blood glucose.
Co-administration of Kaletra with rifampicin is not recommended.
Kaletra is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS.
All interaction studies, when otherwise not stated, were performed using Kaletra capsules, which gives an approximately 20% lower exposure of lopinavir than the 200/ 50 mg tablets.
The clinical significance of this potential interaction is unknown.
Tenofovir: when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was co-administered with Kaletra, tenofovir concentrations were increased by approximately 30% with no changes noted in lopinavir or ritonavir concentrations.
Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir associated adverse events, including renal disorders.
The same recommendations for monitoring apply in these cases of co-administration.
Therefore, concomitant administration of these medicinal products is not recommended.
Kaletra can be co-administered with acid reducing agents with no dose adjustment.
Anticoagulants: warfarin concentrations may be affected when co-administered with Kaletra.
It is recommended that INR (international normalised ratio) be monitored.
Phenytoin levels should be monitored when co-administering with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
This effect may be due to induction of bupropion metabolism.
(e. g. felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine): may have their serum concentrations increased by Kaletra.
Caution should be exercised when Kaletra is co-administered with rosuvastatin.
Dexamethasone: may induce CYP3A4 and may decrease lopinavir concentrations.
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors: phosphodiesterase inhibitors which are dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism, such as tadalafil and sildenafil, are expected to result in an approximately 2-fold and 11-fold increase in AUC respectively, when co-administered with ritonavir containing regimens including Kaletra and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor associated adverse reactions including hypotension, synope, visual changes and prolonged erection.
Cyclosporin, sirolimus (rapamycin) and tacrolimus: concentrations may be increased when co-administered with Kaletra.
Kaletra can be co-administered with buprenorphine with no dose adjustment.
Kaletra was demonstrated to lower plasma concentrations of methadone.
Monitoring plasma concentrations of methadone is recommended.
In case of co-administration of Kaletra with contraceptives containing ethinyl oestradiol (whatever the contraceptive formulation e. g. oral or patch), alternative methods of contraception are to be used.
The dose of Kaletra may need adjusting.
Greater effects may be expected when fluticasone propionate is inhaled.
There are no data from the use of Kaletra in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Studies in rats revealed that lopinavir is excreted in the milk.
Furthermore, rare increases in PR interval have been reported during Kaletra therapy (see section 4.4: sections pancreatitis and lipid elevations).
The adverse reactions are displayed by system organ class.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
Common
Treatment of overdose with Kaletra is to consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.
Inhibition of HIV protease prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein resulting in the production of immature, non-infectious virus.
The median fold IC50 of lopinavir for these 18 isolates at baseline and rebound was 6.9- and 63-fold, respectively, compared to wild type virus.
By intent to treat analysis where patients with missing values are considered virologic failures, the proportion of patients at 48 weeks with HIV RNA < 400 copies/ ml in the Kaletra arm was 75% and 63% in the nelfinavir arm.
Mean baseline CD4 cell count was 259 cells/ mm3 (range:
Through 48 weeks of therapy, a statistically significantly higher proportion of patients in the Kaletra arm had HIV RNA < 50 copies/ ml compared to the nelfinavir arm.
All patients were non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor naïve.
Experienced patients received nevirapine plus up to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of the two dose regimens were assessed after 3 weeks of therapy in each patient.
The plasma levels of ritonavir are less than 7% of those obtained after the ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily.
Ritonavir has been shown to induce metabolic enzymes, resulting in the induction of its own metabolism, and likely the induction of lopinavir metabolism.
After multiple dosing, less than 3% of the lopinavir dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.
The pharmacokinetics of Kaletra oral solution 300/ 75 mg/ m2 twice daily and 230/ 57.5 mg/ m2 twice daily have been studied in a total of 53 paediatric patients, ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years.
Kaletra pharmacokinetics have not been studied in the elderly.
No age or gender related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients.
Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that cardiac lopinavir levels would not be significantly higher than plasma levels.

Karvea is a medicine that contains the active substance irbesartan.
Karvea is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
Karvea is taken by mouth, with or without food.
The usual recommended dose is 150 mg once a day.
Karvea was originally studied in 11 trials for its effects on blood pressure.
Karvea was compared with placebo (a dummy treatment) in 712 patients, and with other medicines for hypertension (atenolol, 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.
Karvea was used for two years or more.
The second study looked at whether Karvea increased the time taken until the patients ’ blood creatinine levels had doubled (a marker of kidney disease), until they needed a kidney transplant or dialysis, or until they died.
In this study, Karvea was compared with placebo and with amlodipine.
There was a 23% relative risk reduction compared with amlodipine.
The main benefit was on the effect on blood creatinine levels.
Its use during the first three months of pregnancy is not recommended.
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Karvea to Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG on 27 August 1997.
The full EPAR for Karvea is available here.
This summary was last updated in 06-2008.
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
Renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function.
Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).
Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Karvea.
Therefore, the use of Karvea is not recommended.
Similar effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far.
Therefore, this combination is not recommended (see section 4.4).
The combination should be administered with caution, especially in the elderly.
Karvea is contraindicated (see section 4.3) during breast-feeding.
Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and/ or gastric lavage.
Irbesartan does not require metabolic activation for its activity.
Peak reduction of blood pressure is achieved within 3-6 hours after administration and the blood pressure lowering effect is maintained for at least 24 hours.
The antihypertensive effects are maintained during long term therapy.
7 The blood pressure lowering effects of irbesartan and thiazide-type diuretics are additive.
When irbesartan is administered concomitantly with a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide (e. g.
No significant difference was apparent between these doses.
Adjusted mean change of trough seated diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) was as follows:
The predefined blood pressure goal was ≤ 135/ 85 mmHg.
While similar blood pressure was achieved in all treatment groups, fewer subjects in the irbesartan 300 mg group (5.2%) than in the placebo (14.9%) or in the irbesartan 150 mg group (9.7%) reached the endpoint of overt proteinuria, demonstrating a 70% relative risk reduction versus placebo (p = 0.0004) for the higher dose.
Irbesartan is metabolised by the liver via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in female patients.
However the terminal half-life was not significantly altered.
No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.
Studies have not been performed in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat or rabbit.

Therefore, the use of Karvezide is not recommended.
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended.
Similar effects have been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far.
Furthermore, renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides so the risk of lithium toxicity could be increased with Karvezide.
Conversely, based on the experience with the use of other medicinal products that blunt the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products that may increase serum potassium levels (e. g. heparin sodium) may lead to increases in serum potassium.
Increase in dosage of probenecid or sulfinpyrazone may be necessary.
Thiazides may increase the risk of adverse effects caused by amantadine.
Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e. g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.

Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
In the event of acute overdose the stomach should be emptied.
Blood electrolytes (especially potassium) must be controlled.
Telithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by acting at the ribosome level.
Telithromycin interferes with the ribosome translation at the 23S ribosomal RNA level, where it interacts with domain V and II.
Development of in vitro resistance to telithromycin due to spontaneous mutation is rare.
While exposure to telithromycin did select for pneumococcal mutants with increased MICs, the MICs remained within the proposed susceptibility range.
Following oral administration, telithromycin is fairly rapidly absorbed.
The in vitro protein binding is approximately 60% to 70%.
Telithromycin is widely distributed throughout the body.
The volume of distribution is 2.9±1.0 l/ kg.
Telithromycin is metabolized primarily by the liver.
The main circulating compound in plasma is telithromycin.
Telithromycin is metabolized both by CYP450 isoenzymes and non-CYP enzymes.
The major CYP450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of telithromycin is CYP3A4.
The non-renal clearance is decreased as the dose is increased.
-Renal impairment In a multiple-dose study, 36 subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, a 1.4-fold increase in Cmax, ss, and a 2-fold increase in AUC (0-24)ss at 800 mg multiple doses in the severe renally impaired group (CLCR < 30 mL/ min) compared to healthy volunteers were observed and a reduced dosage of Ketek is recommended (See Section 4.2.).
These changes in pharmacokinetics do not necessitate dosage adjustment.
-Gender The pharmacokinetics of telithromycin are similar between males and females.
There was evidence of reversibility upon cessation of treatment.
The significance of these findings for humans is unknown.

Be very careful if you do change insulin.
- if you think hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is starting.
Warning signs are listed later in this leaflet.
Using other medicines Your insulin needs may change if you are taking the contraceptive pill, steroids, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, oral hypoglycaemics, acetyl salicylic acid, sulpha antibiotics, octreotide, “beta2 stimulants” (for example ritodrine, salbutamol or terbutaline), beta-blockers, or some antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), danazol, some angiotensin converting (ACE) inhibitors (for example captopril, enalapril), and angiotensin II receptor blockers.
Please keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery).
These instructions are only for you.
Follow them exactly and visit your diabetes clinic regularly. • If you change the type of insulin you use (for example from a human or animal insulin to a Liprolog product), you may have to take more or less than before.
You should not administer it using a different administration route.
Check each time you inject yourself.
There may still be some small air bubbles left in the pen - these are harmless.
Do not inject directly into a vein.
Replace the cap on the pen.
Before every injection, clear any air bubbles.

LITAK is a solution for injection that contains the active substance cladribine (2 mg/ ml).
Because the number of patients with hairy cell leukaemia is low, the disease is considered ‘ rare’, and LITAK was designated an ‘ orphan medicine ’ (a medicine used in rare diseases) on 18 September 2001.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
LITAK is given as an injection under the skin.
It belongs to the group of anti-cancer medicines called ‘ antimetabolites’.
Cladribine is an analogue of purine, one of the fundamental chemicals that make up DNA.
CdATP can also affect other cells, particularly other types of blood cell, which can cause side effects.

The full EPAR for LITAK can be found here.
This summary was last updated in 02-2008.
1 ml of solution for injection contains 2 mg of cladribine (2-CdA).
Each vial of LITAK contains 10 mg of cladribine in 5 ml of solution for injection.
LITAK is indicated for the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia.
Allow LITAK to warm up to room temperature prior to administration.
The risk requires assessment on a case-by-case basis.
In patients less than 16 years of age.
In case of infections, antibiotic treatment should be initiated as required.
Secondary malignancies are expected to occur in patients with hairy cell leukaemia.
Their frequency varies widely, ranging from 2% to 21%.
Cross-reactions with other antineoplastic agents in vitro (e. g. doxorubicin, vincristine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide) and in vivo have not been observed.
It is unknown whether cladribine is excreted in human milk.
4 Cladribine may strongly impair the patient’ s performance.
For severity, please see text below the table.
All patients have been successfully treated by corticosteroids.
No specific antidotal therapy exists.
LITAK contains cladribine as active substance, a purine nucleoside analogue acting as an antimetabolite.
Cell death occurs from energy depletion and apoptosis.
The mean volume of distribution of cladribine is 9.2 l/ kg.
Metabolism Intracellular cladribine is metabolised predominantly by deoxycytidine kinase to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-monophosphate that is further phosphorylated to the diphosphate by nucleoside monophosphate kinase and to the active metabolite 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine- 5'-triphosphate (CdATP) by nucleoside diphosphate kinase.
Cladribine is eliminated mainly by the kidneys.
The fate of the remainder is unknown.
The use of LITAK in children has not been investigated.
Reduced ossification was observed at 1.0 mg/ kg/ day.
Antineoplastic agents, such as cladribine, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected

The mode of administration of Livensa makes overdose unlikely.
Serum levels of androgens fall as women age.
In women, circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to SHBG (65-80%) and to albumin (20-30%) leaving only about 0.5-2% as the free fraction.
Serum concentration of SHBG is influenced by the route of administration of concomitant estrogen therapy.
Testosterone is metabolised to various 17-ketosteroids and further metabolism results in inactive glucuronides and other conjugates.
The active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
DHT has a greater affinity to SHBG than does testosterone.

Therefore, steroid replacement may be necessary in these patients.
Fat tissue can act as a reservoir for mitotane, resulting in a prolonged half-life and potential accumulation of mitotane.
Consequently, despite a constant dose, mitotane levels may increase.
Mitotane has been shown to increase plasma levels of hormone binding proteins (e. g. sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)).
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with mitotane.
Safety data are based on literature (mainly retrospective studies).
Adverse reactions listed below are classified according to frequency and system organ class.
Leucopoenia has been reported in 8 to 12% of patients.
Liver enzymes levels normalize when the mitotane dose is decreased.
A case of cholestatic hepatitis has been reported.
Therefore, the possibility of mitotane-induced liver damage cannot be excluded.
Hypothyroidism and growth retardation may be also observed.
No proven antidotes have been established for mitotane overdose.
Because of its lipophilic nature, mitotane is not likely to be dialysable.
Mitotane apparently causes increased formation of 6-beta- hydroxy cholesterol.
For induction with cytochrome P450, see section 4.5.
